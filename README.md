## Get your copy

This site is supposed to be simple yet extendable. You can edit this to your heart's content, but I respectfully ask that you credit me somehow.
1. Fork this repo (give star pls :D)
2. Edit the files. (mainly the files in the `config` folder)
3. Optionally, add more games. ([Get some here](https://gitlab.com/3kh0/3kh0-assets))
4. Host it on your server or any static web host.
5. Enjoy!

> A known issue is game files; because some games are massive, they will fail on many services. There is no straightforward fix, but you can try to host the files on your server.
## Configuration

All the configuration is done in the `config` folder.
- `games.json`: It contains the games' names, icons, and link, and tags such as hot.

## To-Do
- Make it easier to add games
- Make a better README.md
